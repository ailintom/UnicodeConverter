# Transliteration to Unicode Converter

This PHP script converts Egyptian transliteration passages set in non-Unicode fonts into Unicode following the conventions outlined by D. A. Werning and D. Mastronarde and used in Totenbucharchiv, Ramses, Science in Ancient Egypt and other digital Egyptological projects as well as by some publishers.

The Transliteration to Unicode Converter is running at https://pnm.uni-mainz.de/tools/unicode/

If you use the script outside the web-converter, please use the `convert_to_unicode` function.

The web-page uses the `clipboard.min.js` script developed by Zeno Rocha and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js).

This script is bundled with a subset of the Roboto font by Google, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/google/roboto). See `ROBOTO LICENSE` for the license.
